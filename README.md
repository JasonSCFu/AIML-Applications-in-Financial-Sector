# ML-applications-in-Banking

This repo mainly contains the actual use cases, applications of AI/ML in the banking industry. Some of them are actual projects I completed and some are sparked by industry collaboration sharing. 

I have worked in various roles in the banking industry, including personalized marketing strategy, risk management, fraud detection, robotic process automation (OCR). Over the years, I have seen how banks moving from traditional statistical modelling to AI/ML modelling. With the acceleration of cloud migration and the speed of data accumulation, the trend of using advanced AI/ML will continue and will be the key factors to differentiate with competitor.

The adoption of AI/ML is banking industry has a lot of obstacles including legacy system integration issue, strict regulatory compliance, infrastructure setup investment, data governance/securities issue etc. I will write more about it later.
