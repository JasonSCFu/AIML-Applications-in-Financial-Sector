# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applications in Banking

This repo mainly consists of actual practical use cases, applications of AI/ML in the banking industry. Some of them are actual projects I undertook and some are sparked by industry collaboration sharing. 

I have worked in various roles in the banking industry, including personalized marketing strategy, risk management, fraud detection, robotic process automation (OCR). Over the years, I have seen how banks are trying to move from traditional statistical modelling to AI/ML modelling. With the acceleration of cloud migration and the speed of data accumulation, the trend of using advanced AI/ML will continue and will be the key factors to differentiate with competitors. 

This repo contains AI/ML applications in the following areas:
