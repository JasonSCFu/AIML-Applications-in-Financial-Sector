# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning applications in Banking

This repo mainly consists of actual practical use cases, applications of AI/ML in the banking industry. Some of them are actual projects I undertook and some are sparked by industry collaboration sharing. 

I have worked in various roles in the banking industry, including personalized marketing strategy, risk management, fraud detection, robotic process automation (OCR). Over the years, I have seen how banks are trying to move from traditional statistical modelling to AI/ML modelling. With the acceleration of cloud migration and the speed of data accumulation, the trend of using advanced AI/ML will continue and will be the key factors to differentiate with competitor. 

This repo contains AI/ML applications in the following areas:
### OCR techniques to digitalize banking documents
 -   [Checkbox detection on bank document](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Check_box_detection_on_bank_documents.ipynb)
 -   [Use OCR to extract content from bank document](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/OCR_for_bank_documents.ipynb)
  
### Risk management, fraud detection, AML:
 - [Anomaly detection for credit card fraud](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Anomaly-detection-credit-card-fraud-analysis.ipynb)
 - [Unsupervised anomaly detection for card fraud](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Anomaly%20Detection%20Card%20Fraud.ipynb)
 - [Credit card default prediction using LGBM method](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Credit%20card%20default%20predition%20using%20LGBM.ipynb)
 - [Company bankruptcy prediction](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/company-bankruptcy-prediction.ipynb)
 
### Marketing, targeting, conversion prediction:
 - [Marketing campaign conversion prediction](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/marketing-campaign-conversion-prediction.ipynb)

### ML techniques, pipeline, data processing: 
 - [Automated feature engineering](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Automated_Feature_Engineering.ipynb)
 - [Semi-auto feature selection techniques](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/tree/main/ML%20techniques/Feature%20Selection)
 - [Making sense of time series features](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/ML%20techniques/Making_Sense_Of_Time_Series_Features.ipynb)
 - [Missing value imputation using DataWig](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/AIML-applications-in-Banking/tree/main/ML%20techniques/Missing%20Data%20Imputation/DataWig-Missing-Data-Imputation)

The adoption of AI/ML is banking industry has a lot of obstacles including legacy system integration issue, strict regulatory compliance, infrastructure setup investment, data governance/securities issue etc.
