# ML-applications-in-Banking

This repo mainly contains the actual use cases, applications of AI/ML in the banking industry. Some of them are actual projects I completed and some are sparked by industry collaboration sharing. 

I have worked in various roles in the banking industry, including personalized marketing strategy, risk management, fraud detection, robotic process automation (OCR). Over the years, I have seen how banks moving from traditional statistical modelling to AI/ML modelling. With the acceleration of cloud migration and the speed of data accumulation, the trend of using advanced AI/ML will continue and will be the key factors to differentiate with competitor. 

This repo contains AI/ML applications in the following areas:
OCR techniques to digitalize banking documents
 -   [Checkbox detection on bank document](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Check_box_detection_on_bank_documents.ipynb)
 -   [Use OCR to extract content from bank document](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/OCR_for_bank_documents.ipynb)
  
Risk management, fraud detection, AML
 - [Anomaly detection for credit card fraud](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Anomaly-detection-credit-card-fraud-analysis.ipynb)
 - [Credit card default prediction using LGBM method](https://github.com/JasonSCFu/ML-applications-in-Banking/blob/main/Credit%20card%20default%20predition%20using%20LGBM.ipynb)


The adoption of AI/ML is banking industry has a lot of obstacles including legacy system integration issue, strict regulatory compliance, infrastructure setup investment, data governance/securities issue etc. I will write more about it later.
