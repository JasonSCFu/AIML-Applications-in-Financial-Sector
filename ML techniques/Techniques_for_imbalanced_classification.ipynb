        "An imbalanced classification problem is an example of a classification problem where the distribution of examples across the known classes is biased or skewed. The distribution can vary from a slight bias to a severe imbalance where there is one example in the minority class for hundreds, thousands, or millions of examples in the majority class or classes.\n",

        "Imbalanced classifications pose a challenge for predictive modeling as most of the machine learning algorithms used for classification were designed around the assumption of an equal number of examples for each class. This results in models that have poor predictive performance, specifically for the minority class. This is a problem because typically, the minority class is more important and therefore the problem is more sensitive to classification errors for the minority class than the majority class.\n",

        "\n",
        "NearMiss is an under-sampling technique. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly eliminating majority class examples. When instances of two different classes are very close to each other, we remove the instances of the majority class to increase the spaces between the two classes. This helps in the classification process.\n",
        "To prevent problem of information loss in most under-sampling techniques, near-neighbor methods are widely used.\n",
        "The basic intuition about the working of near-neighbor methods is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Step 1: The method first finds the distances between all instances of the majority class and the instances of the minority class. Here, majority class is to be under-sampled.\n",
        "*   Step 2: Then, n instances of the majority class that have the smallest distances to those in the minority class are selected.\n",
        "*   Step 3: If there are k instances in the minority class, the nearest method will result in k*n instances of the majority class.\n",
        "For finding n closest instances in the majority class, there are several variations of applying NearMiss Algorithm :\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> *    NearMiss – Version 1 : It selects samples of the majority class for which average distances to the k closest instances of the minority class is smallest.\n",

        "\n",
        "> *    NearMiss – Version 2 : It selects samples of the majority class for which average distances to the k farthest instances of the minority class is smallest.\n",
        "\n",
        "> *    NearMiss – Version 3 : It works in 2 steps. Firstly, for each minority class instance, their M nearest-neighbors will be stored. Then finally, the majority class instances are selected for which the average distance to the N nearest-neighbors is the largest."
